# How text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies can help you create accessible videos.

## Introduction
Picture yourself in a world with video-only content without any text or audio.

- Imagine browsing a streaming platform like Netflix or any YouTube channel. There are videos without titles, tags, descriptions, or links. How would you decide what to watch based on just a few images of animations?
- Imagine scrolling your favourite social media platform. There is a playlist of videos with no titles, subtitles, or comments. How can you choose which one is worth your attention and interaction?
- Imagine browsing through your favourite smartphone blog for the latest reviews and finding no text *â€”* just muted advertisements. Would you be willing to purchase a product without first hearing or reading about how its new features might improve or complicate people's lives?
