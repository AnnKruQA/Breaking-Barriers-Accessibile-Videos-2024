# How text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies can help you create accessible videos.

## Introduction

Picture yourself in a world with video-only content without any text or audio.

- Imagine browsing a streaming platform like Netflix or any YouTube channel. There are videos without titles, tags, descriptions, or links. How would you decide what to watch based on just a few images of animations?
- Imagine scrolling your favourite social media platform. There is a playlist of videos with no titles, subtitles, or comments. How can you choose which one is worth your attention and interaction?
- Imagine browsing through your favourite smartphone blog for the latest reviews and finding no text *—* just muted advertisements. Would you be willing to purchase a product without first hearing or reading about how its new features might improve or complicate people's lives?

The human world is mostly shaped by words. It is beneficial to ensure that the spoken language is provided and the written text is correctly displayed.

Do you want to make video content that everyone can enjoy? 

This beginner-friendly guide introduces you to speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies that are valuable for creating accessible videos.

## 1. Accessibility first

### Digital accessibility

Accessibility is a set of considerations that help you to determine whether a solution can be **used independently** by any person, regardless of their abilities or the challenges they face.

Accessibility is a proactive and conscientious approach to diversity that considers the needs, abilities, and experiences of individuals in all forms. The goal is to ensure that all humans, regardless of the constraints they face, they feel valued, respected, and included. It offers people **equal opportunities** to participate comfortably and be equally engaged. It provides independence and enjoyment.

Digital accessibility is the practice of making digital products usable for the widest possible audience. It ensures everyone can **have easy access** to the information they need in applications and effectively use the online services they have chosen.

### Benefits of an inclusive approach

Accessibility is about ensuring the same experience for a wide variety of users who:

- Experience life-long disabilities. These may include visual, hearing, cognitive, speech, and physical impairments.
- Experience hidden disabilities like dyslexia or color blindness.
- Are on the ADHD or Asperger's spectrum.
- Experience life-changing or temporary injuries that may limit their interaction.
- May not be as technologically adept as the younger generation.
- Use outdated hardware.
- Fall into unexpected circumstances.

**We might be temporarily fit for now, but we will be limited at some point in our lives**.

Certainly, some individuals among your students and customers may have visible, invisible, or temporary lack of access to specific news or services.

There are different types of barriers to encounter and overcome:

- **Permanent barriers** are the result of a longstanding medical condition.
- **Temporary barriers** appear due to short-term injuries or conditions, such as ear infections, having atropine eyedrops applied to the eyes, having a broken limb, or suffering from migraine or insomnia.
- **Situational barriers** arise due to certain situations, such as trying to listen to a video in a noisy restaurant or next to a sleeping baby, filling a form on a mobile device in bright sunlight or without glasses, or carrying out a task with one free hand while holding a child in the arms.

ALT: A group of people standing in rows, divided according to the senses (touch, see, hear, speak) and divided into three categories: permanent, temporary, and situational constraints.

Without knowing what people exactly must overcome on a daily basis, or ad hoc, you can address their needs and still help them fulfill required actions.

There are several dimensions to consider when talking about human health and functionality:

- **Physical strength** – depends on the health and capabilities of the body. The user's performance depends on muscular strength, flexibility, and body composition.
- **Cognitive performance** – depends on the functioning of the brain. It includes mental acuity, memory, learning ability, and the ability to solve problems and make decisions.
- **Emotional capacity** – refers to the management of emotions and mental resilience. It includes the ability to express emotions healthily and effectively.
- **Social skills** – include the ability to interact with others. It's about communication skills, empathy, and the ability to work cooperatively with others.

As for cognitive barriers, there are several key elements that you need to consider:

- **Concentration** – it may be challenging to focus on the content when certain conditions are present: a permanent condition such as ADHD or dyslexia, a situational circumstance like being in a rush due to limited time or experiencing nervousness, a temporary state such as being on strong medication or being extremely fatigued.
- **Decoding the text** – it can be particularly difficult for older adults, those with visual impairments, or dyslexia. They may need to strain their eyesight or even reread the content multiple times to fully understand the information being presented to them.
- **Processing the message** – complex terminologies or complicated sentence structures can pose a challenge in understanding the message.
- **Acting based on the message** – the message is not only understood but also prompts the correct action or response from the audience.

### Prioritizing accessibility

People aren’t always comfortable disclosing their disability. Some impairments aren’t visible.

To ensure meeting their needs, the best option is to provide accessibility for all users, whether they need it or not. Not all people who enable subtitles are deaf. Not all people who use a zoom function have low vision. **Prioritizing accessibility is about being kind to others**.

Accessibility isn’t about having the right technical skills but having the **accessibility first mindset**.

It is beneficial to prioritize user experience (UX) on mobile devices from the earliest stage of any project. This is equally true of accessibility, which should be considered right from the start.

Instead of considering accessibility as an extraordinary add-on that can be added at the end of the product life cycle, it should be part of the planning. If left to be considered at a later stage, incorporating accessibility could prove to be not only more difficult but also very costly. Imagine architects having to redesign brand-new buildings to retrofit them for wheelchair access after people have moved in.

With the accessibility first approach, you avoid the necessity to redo half of the elements at the end of a process to comply with accessibility guidelines. The goal is to identify and prevent problems at the design stage and implement necessary elements at the development stage.

Therefore, prioritizing accessibility from the project kick-off is a smart strategy which can save your time, money, and effort in the long run.

If you don't take care of accessibility now, it will generate costs when you are forced to address users' complaints in the future.

## 2. WCAG

### Perceivable time-based media

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide recommendations for making your content accessible.

WCAG is a set of internationally recognized guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content accessible to people with disabilities, such as visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor limitations.

The Perceivable guidelines ensure all users can see, hear, and understand your content, regardless of their abilities. Various digital formats – text, images, audio, and video are engaging as well as can create barriers for some users, particularly those with visual or auditory impairments.

Let's take a closer look at the specific WCAG requirements for the Time-Based Media (1.2) success criteria, which are divided into 3 levels of compliance. WCAG level A represents the minimum level of conformance for basic accessibility. This means any content aiming for accessibility should at least meet the level A criteria. WCAG Level AA is desired and level AAA is considered optional.

Here is the list of perceivable success criteria for all three WCAG levels:

Level A criteria:

1. **Audio-only and video-only (prerecorded)** – For audio-only content, provide a text transcript. For video-only content, provide either an audio description track or a text transcript with an equivalent description of the visual content.
2. **Captions (prerecorded)** – Provide captions for all prerecorded video content that includes audio.
3. **Audio description or media alternative (prerecorded)** – Provide an alternative for video content, such as an audio description track or a text alternative describing the visual content.

Level AA criteria:

1. **Captions (live)** – Offer captions for live video content that includes audio, making the live experience accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers.
2. **Audio Description (prerecorded)** – Provide an audio description track for all prerecorded video content, offering visual context and descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.

Level AAA criteria:

1. **Sign Language (prerecorded)** – For prerecorded video content, provide sign language interpretation to make the content accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers who use sign language.
2. **Extended audio description (prerecorded)** – Provide extended audio description for prerecorded video content, allowing more time to describe complex visual information.
3. **Media alternative (prerecorded)** – Offer an alternative to prerecorded video content, such as a full audio version of the video content for those who prefer listening.
4. **Audio-only (live)** – Provide a live audio-only alternative to video content, such as real-time audio description or a live transcription service.

### Sensory characteristics

The WCAG Sensory Characteristics criterion aims to prevent reliance on sensory information alone to convey essential content or functionality. This ensures that users with diverse sensory abilities can access and understand your content.

These are the principles to create content that delivers information effectively to users with a variety of sensory abilities:

- **Focus on instructions and understanding**: This criterion focuses on how instructions and information are presented. It discourages relying solely on sensory information like sound, shape, size, color, or visual location to convey crucial aspects of the content.
- **Importance of text alternatives**: The guideline emphasizes providing text alternatives for non-text content. This could include alt text for images, transcripts for audio, or captions for video. Text alternatives allow users who cannot perceive the sensory information – blind or deaf to access the equivalent content in a different format.
- **Beyond vision and hearing**: Sensory characteristics extend beyond sight and sound. The criterion encourages considering users with other sensory limitations, such as those who cannot perceive touch or movement.

### WCAG-compliant videos

By following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, you can maximize the impact of your content.

WCAG-compliant videos can **boost audience engagement and understanding**. Many people with disabilities rely on assistive technologies to access online content. These videos ensure compatibility with screen readers, captions software, and other tools, allowing a wider range of users to enjoy your work.

To let your users, regardless of their abilities, engage with live content as it happens and with prepared in-advance content, provide them with automatically generated or manually created text and audio.

Features like captions and audio descriptions ensure that everyone can grasp the nuances of your video, even if they have difficulty hearing the dialogue or seeing all the visual elements.

- **Captions** (prerecorded): They are a text transcript of the spoken dialogue and audio information. Captions are displayed on the screen when the corresponding audio of a prerecorded media file is being played. They serve as a complete audible experience in text form and should be perfectly synchronized with the spoken audio. Furthermore, they also convey sound effects, non-speech sounds, and speaker identification to give the viewers a comprehensive understanding of the scene. Captions to prerecorded video should be highly accurate. They can be created manually or through automated speech recognition software.
- **Captions** (live): They provide text synchronized with live media, such as webinars, presentations, and video conferences. Live captions are synchronized with the live media as much as possible. Due to the processing time required for speech, there might be a slight delay compared to the dialogue’s timing. The speaker identification might be limited. The description of non-speech sounds might be omitted. Live captions may have a higher error rate due to the real-time nature of speech recognition. They are typically generated by automated speech recognition software.
- **Audio description** (prerecorded): It’s an additional narrated track that provides a spoken description of key visual elements, not present in the dialogues. It contributes to the overall comprehension of the content for those who can't see the screen. Audio Description describes the following: the physical environment, locations, and overall atmosphere of the video, the appearance, clothing, and body language of characters, their actions and their interactions.
- **Transcription** (prerecorded): It is a text-based alternative to audio content for those who may prefer to read or those who may need to refer back to the resource later. It can also be beneficial for search engine optimization (SEO).

To offer accessible videos, provide the following:

1. **Clear descriptions**: Don't rely solely on visuals to convey information. Include a text description that accurately explains what's happening in the video, even if it's a simple image. Make sure the user can get the whole story from either the picture or the written description.
2. **Dual communication**: Make sure the main message is understood through both the video itself and the written description. People who can't hear or see the video should still be able to grasp the content.
3. **Alternative text (Alt)**: Describe the element in a way that conveys useful information to the user. Provide a brief and accurate text for elements, such as graphics, diagrams, GIFs, screenshots, and images. It is worth emphasizing that the Alt text is important in the context of film description, not the films themselves. Alt text is displayed on the page if the image fails to load. Alt text is also indexed by search engines.

## 3. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech

When you embrace the power of converting speech and text, you support assistive technology, language accessibility, individuals experiencing disabilities, and people with temporary or situational lack of access to content. You ensure a more accessible, inclusive, and enjoyable video experience for everyone.

- Make your videos accessible to viewers who are deaf or prefer reading by automatically converting spoken language into text.
- Engage viewers who are blind or can’t read by offering an audio description of your video content.
- Expand your audience by making your videos accessible to non-native speakers who might benefit from text in their language.

You can convert spoken language into the following written texts:

1. **Captions** provide synchronized text for dialogue or other kinds of spoken content. Captions make your videos inclusive and welcoming, especially for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. They ensure that your content is accessible in any situation, catering to those in noisy environments or who watch videos with the sound off.
2. **Subtitles** are created for non-native speakers and an international audience by translating spoken content into another language. Your video can reach and engage people worldwide. Subtitles help viewers understand accents or dialects they may not be familiar with, improving their connection with your content.
3. **Transcripts** are like a written map of your spoken content and provide a full dialogue in text form. They support screen readers and other assistive devices, making your content accessible not only to those with visual impairments. They boost your video’s searchability online, helping your content reach a wider audience and gain more visibility. Transcripts offer a valuable resource for life-long learners to study, review, and engage with your content.

You can transform visual elements and actions into spoken language to provide valuable context for your users.

**Audio Description** – narrates visual content, such as scenes, body language, and settings, making videos accessible to viewers who are blind or have low vision. Describing key visual elements, creates an immersive and inclusive experience, making your video content more meaningful for all users.

This is an example of audio description and subtitles.

### Speech-to-text technology

Speech-to-text (STT) technology can be a game-changer in making your video content more accessible. STT, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), transforms spoken language into written text. ASR can generate captions that are displayed on the screen alongside your video, offering real-time access to your spoken content. By incorporating this technology, you can create an inclusive space for people who rely on text-based formats or are deaf and hard of hearing.

### STT best practices

Speech-to-text (STT) technology holds the key to unlocking deeper connections and enriching understanding.

- It allows flexibility in understanding various materials.
- It gives users control and greater independence.
- It supports different needs, lifestyles, and preferences.

Here is the list of best practices for STT:

- **Speak clearly and deliberately**: Speak at a moderate pace and enunciate words to enhance transcription quality.
- **Limit overlapping speech**: Avoid situations where multiple people speak simultaneously, as this can confuse the ASR tool.
- **Recognize each voice**: Clearly indicate speaker changes in captions and transcripts for smoother, intuitive reading.
- **Customize**: Opt for tools that allow you to customize language models, helping the software understand your specific language usage and accent.
- **Focus on accuracy**: Produce the most precise transcription possible, especially when you capture complex topics or difficult terminology.
- **Check timing**: Make sure that subtitles are well-timed and stay on the screen just long enough to be read at a natural pace.
- **Offer extra support**: Provide supplementary materials, like summaries or mind maps, for your users to engage with your content.
- **Check and edit**: Consistently review to ensure accuracy and clarity. Take the time to refine automatically generated captions and transcripts.
- **Collect feedback**: Be open to adjustments. Tailor your content to specific needs and preferences.

### Text-to-speech technology

Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that converts written content into an auditory format. It is designed to support individuals with visual impairments, dyslexia, or other reading challenges.

TTS system uses speech synthesis algorithms to generate speech from text, ranging from robotic-sounding to natural human-like voices. It can be used in various applications, including web pages, documents, and multimedia content to let people consume content audibly.

### TTS best practices

Text-to-speech (TTS) technology can create an inclusive environment that enhances both educational experiences and entertainment.

- It allows flexibility in understanding various materials.
- It gives users control and greater independence.
- It supports different needs, lifestyles, and preferences.

Here is the list of best practices for TTS:

- **Simple language**: Use straightforward language to facilitate easier speech synthesis. Avoid overly complex and ambiguous sentences. Clear text makes it easier for TTS software to produce understandable speech.
- **Captioning**: Ensure that your video content includes accurate captions that can be read aloud using TTS.
- **Integration**: Ensure that spoken audio matches the visual content for a cohesive experience.
- **Proper punctuation**: Take care of punctuation that helps the TTS system understand the flow and tone of the text.
- **Natural voices**: Select TTS software that provides various voice options, such as male and female voices with different accents for better comprehension. Select a natural-sounding voice to make content more engaging.
- **Multiple access**: Make the audio available as downloadable files or streaming options, allowing users to choose how they engage with your content. Ensure the TTS software can handle various file formats (e.g., text, PDF, Word) to provide maximum flexibility.
- **Testing playback**: Always test the TTS playback to ensure clarity and proper pronunciation.
- **Usability testing**: Let people test your content to ensure the TTS works well and the conveyed message is understandable.
- **Continuous improvement**: Implement users’ feedback to improve the quality and accessibility of your videos.
- **Automation**: Look for video platforms that offer TTS plugins for automated reading.

## 4. Making accessible videos

### Guidelines

The following list outlines key phases of creating inclusive and engaging videos that will help you reach a wider audience.

1. **Plan your content and tools**:
- Define your target group and recording space.
- Outline the key objectives for your content. Break down complex ideas into smaller chunks.
- Prepare visuals and extra activities for your audience.
- Explore the interface of a recording tool and get familiar with the different recording modes.

2. **Create the environment**:

**For filming**:

- Prepare your workstation.
- Arrange the background.
- Check the quality of the lighting. Ensure good lighting in your recording space. Avoid harsh shadows or backlighting.
- Check the quality of the sound system.
- Invest in an additional microphone if your computer's built-in mic doesn't offer good audio quality.

**For recording the screen**:

- Select a region or a window.
- Disable functions that you do not need, such as web recording or screen cursor.

3. **Create a video**:
- Maintain eye contact with the camera as if you're talking directly to your audience.
- Draw attention to key points on your screen by highlighting specific areas or adding annotations on the fly.
- Keep it simple. Avoid overloading your video with too much information or complex ideas.

4. **Edit your video**:
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes and a logical flow of information.
- Introduce key concepts visually with clear title cards.
- Incorporate visuals like pictures, diagrams, or short video clips to enhance understanding.
- Keep the background music low to avoid interfering with the dialogue.

5. **Add captions**:
- Use a captioning tool.
- Check if captions are synchronized with the audio. They should appear on the screen precisely as the corresponding dialogue is spoken.
- Use simple and concise language.
- Choose a sufficient font size with high-contrast color for easy reading. Required contrast ratios between text and the background are 4.5:1 for regular text and 3:1 for large text (18 pt or 14 pt + bold).

6. **Create a transcription**:
- Provide a clear written representation of your video's audio content.
- Play your video and type as you watch all dialogues and narration word-for-word into a text editor.
- Listen for non-verbal sounds and include them in brackets within your transcript, for example [laughter], [upbeat music].
- Download an automatically generated transcription from a video creator tool.
- Ensure the transcripts accurately reflect the audio content of your video.
- Format the transcription for readability. Add clear headings to separate sections in your transcript and break up the text into paragraphs.
- Add timestamps to help your viewers easily reference specific parts of the video, for example, "[0:30] Hello everyone, and welcome to ..."
- Offer transcripts as a separate document for people who prefer reading and using written references.
- Consider offering transcripts in multiple formats, e.g., PDF, or Word document.

7. **Write an audio description**:
- Insert audio descriptions during natural pauses in the dialogue or narration to ensure that individuals can hear both the description and the main audio content of a video.
- Use a clear and natural voice to describe key visual elements for blind or visually impaired individuals.
- Provide a spoken narration of scenes and settings - locations, overall atmosphere; characters’ appearance and clothes, their actions and interactions; and important objects.
- Don't describe every single detail in your video. Focus on the essential elements that are crucial for understanding the context.
- Use clear language. Avoid jargon or technical terms.

8. **Test and revise**:
- Preview your video.
- Test yourself the recorded content and generated sounds.
- Review your captions, transcription, and audio description.
- Check your audio description.
- Test your content with the target audience. It is crucial to have it checked by impaired users.
