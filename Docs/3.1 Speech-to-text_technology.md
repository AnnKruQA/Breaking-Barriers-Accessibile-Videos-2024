Speech-to-text (STT) technology can be a game-changer in making your video content more accessible. STT, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), transforms spoken language into written text. ASR can generate captions that are displayed on the screen alongside your video, offering real-time access to your spoken content. By incorporating this technology, you can create an inclusive space for people who rely on text-based formats or are deaf and hard of hearing.
