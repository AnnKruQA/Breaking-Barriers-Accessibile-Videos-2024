## 3. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech

When you embrace the power of converting speech and text, you support assistive technology, language accessibility, individuals experiencing disabilities, and people with temporary or situational lack of access to content. You ensure a more accessible, inclusive, and enjoyable video experience for everyone.

- Make your videos accessible to viewers who are deaf or prefer reading by automatically converting spoken language into text.
- Engage viewers who are blind or can’t read by offering an audio description of your video content.
- Expand your audience by making your videos accessible to non-native speakers who might benefit from text in their language.

You can convert spoken language into the following written texts:

1. **Captions** provide synchronized text for dialogue or other kinds of spoken content. Captions make your videos inclusive and welcoming, especially for deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. They ensure that your content is accessible in any situation, catering to those in noisy environments or who watch videos with the sound off.
2. **Subtitles** are created for non-native speakers and an international audience by translating spoken content into another language. Your video can reach and engage people worldwide. Subtitles help viewers understand accents or dialects they may not be familiar with, improving their connection with your content.
3. **Transcripts** are like a written map of your spoken content and provide a full dialogue in text form. They support screen readers and other assistive devices, making your content accessible not only to those with visual impairments. They boost your video’s searchability online, helping your content reach a wider audience and gain more visibility. Transcripts offer a valuable resource for life-long learners to study, review, and engage with your content.

This is an example of transcription and captions in English for a lesson from the [Creating Accessible and Inclusive Video course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-accessible-and-inclusive-video) on LinkedIn.

You can transform visual elements and actions into spoken language to provide valuable context for your users.

**Audio Description** – narrates visual content, such as scenes, body language, and settings, making videos accessible to viewers who are blind or have low vision. Describing key visual elements, creates an immersive and inclusive experience, making your video content more meaningful for all users.

This is an example of audio description and subtitles.
