### 2.1 Perceivable time-based media


The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 provide recommendations for making your content accessible.

WCAG is a set of internationally recognized guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content accessible to people with disabilities, such as visual, auditory, cognitive, and motor limitations.

The Perceivable guidelines ensure all users can see, hear, and understand your content, regardless of their abilities. Various digital formats – text, images, audio, and video are engaging as well as can create barriers for some users, particularly those with visual or auditory impairments.

Let's take a closer look at the specific WCAG requirements for the Time-Based Media (1.2) success criteria, which are divided into 3 levels of compliance. WCAG level A represents the minimum level of conformance for basic accessibility. This means any content aiming for accessibility should at least meet the level A criteria. WCAG Level AA is desired and level AAA is considered optional.

Here is the list of perceivable success criteria for all three WCAG levels:

#### Level A criteria:

1. **Audio-only and video-only (prerecorded)** – For audio-only content, provide a text transcript. For video-only content, provide either an audio description track or a text transcript with an equivalent description of the visual content.
2. **Captions (prerecorded)** – Provide captions for all prerecorded video content that includes audio.
3. **Audio description or media alternative (prerecorded)** – Provide an alternative for video content, such as an audio description track or a text alternative describing the visual content.

#### Level AA criteria:

1. **Captions (live)** – Offer captions for live video content that includes audio, making the live experience accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers.
2. **Audio Description (prerecorded)** – Provide an audio description track for all prerecorded video content, offering visual context and descriptions for viewers who are blind or have low vision.

#### Level AAA criteria:

1. **Sign Language (prerecorded)** – For prerecorded video content, provide sign language interpretation to make the content accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers who use sign language.
2. **Extended audio description (prerecorded)** – Provide extended audio description for prerecorded video content, allowing more time to describe complex visual information.
3. **Media alternative (prerecorded)** – Offer an alternative to prerecorded video content, such as a full audio version of the video content for those who prefer listening.
4. **Audio-only (live)** – Provide a live audio-only alternative to video content, such as real-time audio description or a live transcription service.
