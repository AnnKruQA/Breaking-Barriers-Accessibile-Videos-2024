Accessibility is a set of considerations that help you to determine whether a solution can be **used independently** by any person, regardless of their abilities or the challenges they face.

Accessibility is a proactive and conscientious approach to diversity that considers the needs, abilities, and experiences of individuals in all forms. The goal is to ensure that all humans, regardless of the constraints they face, they feel valued, respected, and included. It offers people **equal opportunities** to participate comfortably and be equally engaged. It provides independence and enjoyment.

Digital accessibility is the practice of making digital products usable for the widest possible audience. It ensures everyone can **have easy access** to the information they need in applications and effectively use the online services they have chosen.
