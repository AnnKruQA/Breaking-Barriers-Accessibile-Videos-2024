Text-to-speech (TTS) technology can create an inclusive environment that enhances both educational experiences and entertainment.

- It allows flexibility in understanding various materials.
- It gives users control and greater independence.
- It supports different needs, lifestyles, and preferences.

Here is the list of best practices for TTS:

- **Simple language**: Use straightforward language to facilitate easier speech synthesis. Avoid overly complex and ambiguous sentences. Clear text makes it easier for TTS software to produce understandable speech.
- **Captioning**: Ensure that your video content includes accurate captions that can be read aloud using TTS.
- **Integration**: Ensure that spoken audio matches the visual content for a cohesive experience.
- **Proper punctuation**: Take care of punctuation that helps the TTS system understand the flow and tone of the text.
- **Natural voices**: Select TTS software that provides various voice options, such as male and female voices with different accents for better comprehension. Select a natural-sounding voice to make content more engaging.
- **Multiple access**: Make the audio available as downloadable files or streaming options, allowing users to choose how they engage with your content. Ensure the TTS software can handle various file formats (e.g., text, PDF, Word) to provide maximum flexibility.
- **Testing playback**: Always test the TTS playback to ensure clarity and proper pronunciation.
- **Usability testing**: Let people test your content to ensure the TTS works well and the conveyed message is understandable.
- **Continuous improvement**: Implement users’ feedback to improve the quality and accessibility of your videos.
- **Automation**: Look for video platforms that offer TTS plugins for automated reading.
