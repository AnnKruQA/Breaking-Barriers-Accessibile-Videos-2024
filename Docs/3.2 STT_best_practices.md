Speech-to-text (STT) technology holds the key to unlocking deeper connections and enriching understanding.

- It allows flexibility in understanding various materials.
- It gives users control and greater independence.
- It supports different needs, lifestyles, and preferences.

Here is the list of best practices for STT:

- **Speak clearly and deliberately**: Speak at a moderate pace and enunciate words to enhance transcription quality.
- **Limit overlapping speech**: Avoid situations where multiple people speak simultaneously, as this can confuse the ASR tool.
- **Recognize each voice**: Clearly indicate speaker changes in captions and transcripts for smoother, intuitive reading.
- **Customize**: Opt for tools that allow you to customize language models, helping the software understand your specific language usage and accent.
- **Focus on accuracy**: Produce the most precise transcription possible, especially when you capture complex topics or difficult terminology.
- **Check timing**: Make sure that subtitles are well-timed and stay on the screen just long enough to be read at a natural pace.
- **Offer extra support**: Provide supplementary materials, like summaries or mind maps, for your users to engage with your content.
- **Check and edit**: Consistently review to ensure accuracy and clarity. Take the time to refine automatically generated captions and transcripts.
- **Collect feedback**: Be open to adjustments. Tailor your content to specific needs and preferences.
