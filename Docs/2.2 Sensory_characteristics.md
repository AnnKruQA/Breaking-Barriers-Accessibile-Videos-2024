### Sensory characteristics

The WCAG Sensory Characteristics criterion aims to prevent reliance on sensory information alone to convey essential content or functionality. This ensures that users with diverse sensory abilities can access and understand your content.

These are the principles to create content that delivers information effectively to users with a variety of sensory abilities:

- **Focus on instructions and understanding**: This criterion focuses on how instructions and information are presented. It discourages relying solely on sensory information like sound, shape, size, color, or visual location to convey crucial aspects of the content.
- **Importance of text alternatives**: The guideline emphasizes providing text alternatives for non-text content. This could include alt text for images, transcripts for audio, or captions for video. Text alternatives allow users who cannot perceive the sensory information â€“ blind or deaf to access the equivalent content in a different format.
- **Beyond vision and hearing**: Sensory characteristics extend beyond sight and sound. The criterion encourages considering users with other sensory limitations, such as those who cannot perceive touch or movement.
